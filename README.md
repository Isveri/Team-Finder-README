# TEAM FINDER
## INTRODUCTION
Team Finder is a project created to consolidate and expand my knowledge of application development using Java with the Spring framework.
## STATUS
The project is still under development, which means that it may have some shortcomings due to the fact that I am currently the only person testing it. I am also aware that some things can be done better, which is why I try to refactor it on an ongoing basis, along with my expanding knowledge (this applies to the version based on microservices, the monolith is no longer modified).
